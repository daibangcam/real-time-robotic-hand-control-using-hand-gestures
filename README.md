 Interpretation of human gestures by a computer is used for human-machine interaction in the area of computer vision. The main purpose of gesture recognition research is to identify a particular human gesture and convey information to the user pertaining to individual gesture. From the corpus of gestures, specific gesture of interest can be identified, and on the basis of that, specific command for execution of action can be given to robotic system. Overall aim is to make the computer understand human body language, thereby bridging the gap between machine and human. Hand gesture recognition can be used to enhance humanâ€“computer interaction without depending on traditional input devices such as keyboard and mouse. Hand gestures are extensively used for telerobotic control applications. Robotic systems can be controlled naturally and intuitively with such telerobotic communication. A prominent benefit of such a system is that it presents a natural way to send geometrical information to the robot such as: left, right, etc. Robotic hand can be controlled remotely by hand gestures. Research is being carried out in this area for a long time. 

 In this chapter, we have proposed a fast as well as automatic hand gesture detection and recognition system.
